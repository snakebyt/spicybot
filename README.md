This is a joke. But we might be able to replace spicypixel with code anyway.

Config files:

config.json = a json file containing an array with the config for the bot. requires channels, server, botName, pass, isAuthed: false


Next features: 

-respond to automation messages

-so tvshow isnt bad eonder what theyll do for season

-amazon affiliate links

-responses

-calorific responses for things that sound fatty. random callory count, if I had to guess.

-regular users - someone new joins, have it highlight bret and say it's happening again


Future plans:
Log one-word responses for future use from spicypixel.
